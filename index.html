I'm a originally from Vancouver, Canada and currently living in Berlin. I'm a developer by background, shifted into
product, and am now co-founding a startup. I've been focused on Legal Tech for around seven years now, including my last
full time role at Contractually. I originally joined Contractually as the first full-time engineer, commercialized the
product from an initial alpha version, and helped establish the team that got us to an acquisition by Coupa (NASDAQ:
COUP).
