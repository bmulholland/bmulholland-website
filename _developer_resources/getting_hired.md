One key point is that company culture is really important to the success of a company, and the main way that companies
can set the culture is by hiring people that match it. This is often about things that you might not care about (that's
why it's not a fit!) and that's *okay*. This means that you may get rejected from a job for reasons that are completely
outside your control; you may even have been perfectly qualified. Especially difficult is that it's often nigh
impossible to explain why this is the case, and so you may not even get a reason for being rejected.  It can be hard to
process this, but try not to take these rejections too personally. It's not your fault, and it's certainly not a
judgment of you as a person. Have you ever met someone who was a perfectly fine person but you just didn't quite connect
with? Yeah.

### Preparing for Coding Questions

Coding samples are a controversial but standard component of programming interviews. Live coding exercises are not
representative of real-life situations, especially due to the pressure, while take-homes tend to filter out those who
have a family (or are busy for other reasons). Unfortunately, employers learn time and time again that they are
necessary because there are [so many applicants for jobs who are not able to do even the most basic programming tasks.](

(Seriously, read that to get some perspectivE). Net net, you need to be prepared.

There's some good ideas to prep in the writeup above on Perspective, tips and tricks.
